## Biggest Challenges

The main challenges faced during the project were:

- Ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
- Managing date handling and the login functionality, which required dedicated time and effort.

## Branding and Design

Prior to starting the project, a benchmark study was conducted to capture the dominant colors and tone of voice used by luxury hospitality brands. The name "Otium," meaning "rest" in Latin, influenced the logo design. The voluptuous "O" and the "T" resembling a growing tree were incorporated, with the trunk slowly flowing across the pages like a guiding thread for users. The design mockups can be found : https://www.figma.com/file/zc46H8VXrLGXUpW4LPHpvP/Final-Project-%2F-OTIUM?type=design&node-id=15%3A26&t=JGIVmN0XV7Bi7viB-1.
